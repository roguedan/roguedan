# 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Williams (@roguedan)

Engineering leader with 20+ years of experience scaling fintech, trading, and e-commerce platforms globally.  
Currently pivoting my deep TradFi + platform modernization background toward **Web3 infrastructure**, **DeFi protocols**, and **decentralized application architecture**.

🌍 Based in Melbourne — working remote in **Brazil timezone**.

## 🧠 What I’m Focused On

- 🪙 **Web3 Infrastructure** — building secure bridges between TradFi systems and decentralized networks  
- 🧰 **Go / Node.js / TypeScript** — REST APIs, wallet authentication, and OpenAPI-driven services  
- 🧠 **Agentic & AI-native Dev** — exploring workflows that combine AI with blockchain apps  
- 🧪 **L2 + On-chain Data** — using Dune, The Graph, and custom pipelines for analytics & compliance
